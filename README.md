# Dog cat classification
# webserver link https://dogcatproject-keh36rsrc2h7vjltpqwhts.streamlit.app/ðŸ”— 
This is a simple image classifier web application built using Streamlit and TensorFlow/Keras. It allows users to upload an image and uses a pre-trained deep learning model to predict whether the image contains a dog or a cat.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
# git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
# pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
# streamlit run app.py
Upload an image by clicking on the "Choose an image..." button.

Click the "Predict" button to see the prediction result.

# Model
The deep learning model used for this app is model.h5, which is a pre-trained model for image classification.

Libraries Used
Streamlit: For creating the web application interface.
TensorFlow: For loading the pre-trained model and making predictions.
Keras: For image preprocessing and loading the model.
Credits
This project is based on the Streamlit documentation and TensorFlow/Keras tutorials.
